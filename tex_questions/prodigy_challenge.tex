    \title{Prodigy Algorithmic Design Challenge}

    \author{Stepan Oskin}

    \begin{abstract}

        You are given a list of tasks $T = T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n$.
        Each task is to be done on a computer.
        Some tasks are easy, other tasks are hard.
        (Some examples of tasks could be typing, or coding, or answering multiple-choice questions.)
        You also have a set of users $U$ who have different abilities on these tasks.
        The goal of this challenge is to produce a pseudo-code heuristic to solve each step of the challenge, supported by explanations, assumptions, or working code.
