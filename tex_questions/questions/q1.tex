\chapter{Estimate the difficulty of each task} \label{ch:q1_difficulty}

\section{Question 1} \label{sec:q1}

You want to estimate the difficulty of each task.
Each user is given a random sample of tasks from $T$ to attempt.
How can you use the performance of users (on the random task sample they are given) to estimate the difficulty of all the tasks in $T$?
(You can only use observations on the computational tasks - no biometrics, direct observation, etc.
Imagine you can see what is on a user's computer screen but nothing else.)

\section{Solution} \label{sec:q1_solution}

\subsection{Absolute and relative difficulty of a task $T_k$} \label{subsec:q1_abs_rel_difficulty}

Since it is given that users in $U$ have different abilities on tasks in $T$, when discussing the assessment of the difficulty of a task $T_k$ there are two distinct definitions of difficulty that have to be considered:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item absolute measure of difficulty for task $T_k$

    One of the ways to define the absolute measure of difficulty for a given task $T_k$, or $D_{abs}(T_k)$, is through empirically observed percentage of correct responses from all the answers, $p(T_k)$, that were provided by the subset of users $U_{T_k}$ who attempted the given task $T_k$.
    This measure indicates the difficulty of a given task as expressed by the ratio of users who were able to solve it correctly.

    \item relative measure of difficulty for task $T_k$

    Relative measure of difficulty for the task $T_k$ in relation with the user $U_i$, or $D_{rel}(T_k, U_i)$, can be defined as $D_{abs}(T_k)$ corrected for the current level of abilities of a given user $U_i$.
    This measure reflects the fact that the two users $U_i$ and $U_j$ might find the same task $T_k$ to have different level of difficulty, depending on their current abilities in a given subject.
    Furthermore, the same user $U_i$ can find the same task $T_k$ to have higher or lower level of difficulty at different points in time (e.g., if the user $U_i$ improves their skills through practice).
    $D_{rel}(T_k, U_i)$ is intended to reflect both of these differences when assessing the relative difficulty of a given task $T_k$ in relation to a given user $U_i$.
\end{enumerate}

This section is concerned with the absolute difficulty, $D_{abs}(T_k)$, of a task as reflected by the performance of the subset of users $U_{T_k}$ who have attempted the task $T_k$.
Relative task difficulty $D_{rel}(T_k, U_i)$ will be discussed further in section~\ref{subsec:q3_drel}.

\subsection{Determining absolute task difficulty $D_{abs}(T_k)$ using difficulty index} \label{subsec:q1_difficulty_index}

Difficulty index presents a basic approach to determining absolute task difficulty: difficulty $p$ of each task $T_k$ can be determined as the fraction of the correct responses provided by all the users who attempted it:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dabs}
    \label{eq:task_difficulty}
    D_{abs}(T_k) = P(Ans=Corr|T_k) = \frac{\text{Correct answers}} {\text{Total answers}}
\end{equation}

This approach assumes that each task in $T$ was only shown to the subset of users $U_{T_k}$, for whom this task is relevant (e.g., tasks and users are grouped by school year).
Also, in this approach, individual skill level of users is not taken into account;
instead, absolute task difficulty $D_{abs}(T_k)$ can be interpreted as the expectation of the probability of an average user $U_i$ solving the given task $T_k$ correctly, as reflected by the subset of users $U_{T_k}$ who attempted this task:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dabs_interpretation}
    D_{abs}(T_k) = E[P(Ans=Corr)|T_k, U_i \in U_{T_k}]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Uncertainty due to the size of subsets $U_{T_k}$} \label{subsec:q1_dabs_uncertainty}

Since in our case each task $T_k$ is only attempted by a subset of users $U_{T_k}$, when using the definition of absolute task difficulty $D_{abs}(T_k)$ presented in equation~\ref{eq:dabs_interpretation}, the assumption is that the expectation of probability of correct answer for an average user from the sample $U_{T_k}$ is close to that for an average user from the whole population $U$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dabs_assumption}
    E[P(Ans=Corr|T_k, U_i \in U_{T_k})] \approx E[P(Ans=Corr|T_k, U_i \in U)]
\end{equation}

Since it is said that users are given randomized subsets of tasks from $T$, given the large number of users and tasks, it can be assumed that for most tasks in $T$, each task $T_k$ is shown to a large random sample of users $U_{T_k}$ whose skill level and platform usage patterns are representative of the whole population of users in $U$;
in this case, absolute difficulty $D_{abs}(T_k)$ of the task $T_k$ can be assumed to offer an unbiased estimate of absolute task difficulty with respect to all users in $U$.

However, this assumption is more likely to hold true in cases where most subsets of users $U_{T_k}$ are sufficiently large, that is, enough users have attempted to solve most tasks in $T$.
To determine the uncertainty of this method, distribution of sample sizes $U_{T_k}$ can be compared with the size of the population $U$ for all tasks in $T$.
The effect of sample sizes on difficulty estimates can be mitigating by using the uncertainty of each estimate as a weight coefficient when combining empirical absolute difficulty $D_{abs}(T_k)$ with expert estimate $D_{expt}(T_k)$ to determine the composite absolute task difficulty $D_{comp}(T_k)$, which will be discussed in section~\ref{subsec:q2_dcomp}.
In addition, analysis of the distribution of $D_{abs}$ obtained empirically could be used to test the assumption and inform the design of a more meaningful scoring system that can be used to determine the absolute difficulty of a task.
